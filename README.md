# Intel-RealSense-Navigation-Library

**About the library**

Library aimed at assisting and easing integration or RealSense Gesture and voice controlled web applications. Included with the Library is a working sample document. The sample demonstrates the use of Intel® RealSense™ Navigation library, which is a simple interface to the Intel® RealSense™ SDK for Web. Out of the box the library provides the ability to easily integrate an end-to-end solution for gesture and voice recognition in your web page. The library also allows you to subscribe to speech and gesture events, to further customize and tailor the experience to your application. The following is what you will learn from this sample:

-	Query if the system is RealSense capable
-	Check RealSense components are up-to-date
-	Gestures to play/pause a video
-	Gestures to interact with hyperlinks and other page elements
