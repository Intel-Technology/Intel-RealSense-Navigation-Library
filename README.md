# Intel® RealSense™ Web Navigation Library

**About the library**

This Library is aimed at assisting and easing integration or Intel® RealSense™ gesture and voice technology to control web applications. Included with the Library is a working Intel code sample, available under the Intel's sample code license. The sample demonstrates the use of the Intel® RealSense™ Navigation library, which is a simple interface to the Intel® RealSense™ SDK for Web. Out of the box the library provides the ability to easily integrate an end-to-end solution for gesture and voice recognition in your web page. The library also allows you to subscribe to speech and gesture events, to further customize and tailor the experience to your application. The following is provided in this sample:

-	Query if the system is Intel® RealSense™ capable
-	Check that Intel® RealSense™ components are up-to-date
-	Use Gestures to play/pause a video
-	Use Gestures to interact with hyperlinks and other page elements
